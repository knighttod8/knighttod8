- 👋 Hi, I’m @knighttod8. This is a temporary alias given by the github random name generator. For now, this will have to do.
- 👀 I’m interested in.. I'm blank as I'm pondering this inquiry.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python first and expect to explore others including C/C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. My technical abilities are seemingly lacking and it's only going to stunt my development.
- 📫 How to reach me.. is dependent on the nature of your request.
